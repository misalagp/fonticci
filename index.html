                    <p>A Gnat alighted on one of the horns of a Bull, and remained sitting there for a considerable time. When it had rested sufficiently and was about to fly away, it said to the Bull, &ldquo;Do you mind if I go now?&rdquo; The Bull merely raised his eyes and remarked, without interest, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one to me; I didn&rsquo;t notice when you came, and I shan&rsquo;t know when you go away.&rdquo;</p>

                    <h2>Proust <br>on wisdom</h2>
                    <p>“We do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness 
                        which no one else can make for us, which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view 
                        from which we come at last to regard the world. The lives that you admire, the attitudes that seem
                         noble to you, have not been shaped by a paterfamilias or a schoolmaster, they have sprung from
                          very different beginnings, having been influenced by evil or commonplace that prevailed round them.
                           They represent a struggle and a victory.”
                    </p>

Suddenly there came running up one who told him that his house had been broken into by thieves, and that they had made off with everything they could lay hands on. He was up in a moment, and rushed off, tearing his hair and calling down curses on the miscreants. The bystanders were much amused, and one of them said, &ldquo;&#8201;Our friend professes to know what is going to happen to others, but it seems he&rsquo;s not clever enough to perceive what&rsquo;s in store for himself.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>There was once an Astronomer whose habit it was to go out at night and observe the stars. One night, as he was walking about outside the town gates, gazing up absorbed into the sky and not looking where he was going, he fell into a dry well. As he lay there groaning, some one passing by heard him, and, coming to the edge of the well, looked down and, on learning what had happened, said, &ldquo;If you really mean to say that you were looking so hard at the sky that you didn&rsquo;t even see where your feet were carrying you along the ground, it appears to me that you deserve all you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>

                        What greater thing is there for two human souls, than to feel that they are joined for life--to strengthen each other in all labor, to rest on each other in all sorrow, to minister to each other in all pain, to be one with each other in silent unspeakable memories at the moment of the last parting?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You must love your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting your play to begin. And the other is, you must not be ashamed of your work, and think it would be more honorable to you to be doing something else. You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it well, and not be always saying, There’s this and there’s that—if I had this or that to do, I might make something of it. No matter what a man is—I wouldn’t give twopence for him, whether he was the prime minister or the rick-thatcher, if he didn’t do well what he undertook to do.

                        Have patience with everything that remains unsolved in your heart. Try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books written in a foreign language. Do not now look for the answers. They cannot now be given to you because you could not live them. It is a question of experiencing everything. At present you need to live the question. Perhaps you will gradually, without even noticing it, find yourself experiencing the answer, some distant day.

                        So don't be frightened, dear friend, if a sadness confronts you larger than any you have ever known, casting its shadow over all you do. You must think that something is happening within you, and remember that life has not forgotten you; it holds you in its hand and will not let you fall. Why would you want to exclude from your life any uneasiness, any pain, any depression, since you don't know what work they are accomplishing within you.

                        <p>A singing bird was confined in a cage which hung outside a window,
                            and had a way of singing at night when all other birds were asleep.
                            One night a Bat came and clung to the bars of the cage, and asked
                            the Bird why she was silent by day and sang only at night. "I have a
                            very good reason for doing so," said the Bird. "It was once when I was
                            singing in the daytime that a fowler was attracted by my voice, and
                            set his nets for me and caught me. Since then I have never sung except
                            by night." But the Bat replied, "It is no use your doing that now when
                            you are a prisoner: if only you had done so before you were caught,
                            you might still have been free."

                <p>The heaviest of burdens crushes us, we sink beneath it, it pins us to the ground. But in the love poetry of every age, the woman longs to be weighed down by the man’s body. The heaviest of burdens is therefore simultaneously an image of life’s most intense fulfillment. The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become. Conversely, the absolute absence of a burden causes man to be lighter than air, to soar into heights, take leave of the earth and his earthly being, and become only half real, his movements as free as they are insignificant. What then shall we choose? Weight or lightness?</p>
                <blockquote>&ldquo;A person who longs to leave the place where he lives is an unhappy person. And yet the one who is never going to leave is unhappy too. It is possible to be happy in the place one lives, but to live and die without ever having been happy in it, to die outside the place one loves, is tragic.&rdquo;</blockquote>

                    <p>A Crow became very jealous of a Raven, because the latter was regarded by men as a bird of omen which foretold the future, and was accordingly held in great respect by them. She was very anxious to get the same sort of reputation herself; and, one day, seeing some travellers approaching, she flew on to a branch of a tree at the roadside and cawed as loud as she could. The travellers were in some dismay at the sound, for they feared it might be a bad omen; till one of them, spying the Crow, said to his companions, <q>It&rsquo;s all right, my friends, we can go on without fear, for it&rsquo;s only a crow and that means nothing.</q></p>

According to Tartini's account given to the French astronomer Jérôme Lalande, he dreamed that he had made a pact with the devil, to whom he had handed a violin after a music lesson, in order to assess whether the devil could play. The devil then proceeded to play "with such great art and intelligence, as I had never even conceived in my boldest flights of fantasy".</p>
                        <p>Tartini said that on waking he "immediately grasped my violin in order to retain, in part at least, the impression of my dream".</p>

                    <p>
                    A Queen Bee from Hymettus flew up to Olympus with some fresh honey from the hive as a present to Jupiter, who was so pleased with the gift that he promised to give her anything she liked to ask for. She said she would be very grateful if he would give stings to the bees, to kill people who robbed them of their honey. Jupiter was greatly displeased with this request, for he loved mankind: but he had given his word, so he said that stings they should have. The stings he gave them, however, were of such a kind that whenever a bee stings a man the sting is left in the wound and the bee dies.

                            <p>Man shouldn’t be able to see his own face – there’s nothing more sinister. Nature gave him the gift of not being able to see it, and of not being able to stare into his own eyes.
                                Only in the water of rivers and ponds could he look at his face. And the very posture he had to assume was symbolic. He had to bend over, stoop down, to commit the ignominy of beholding himself.
                                The inventor of the mirror poisoned the human heart.

All these half-tones of the soul’s consciousness create in us a painful landscape, an eternal sunset of what we are.</p>

                        I want to climb some old gray mountains, slowly, taking<br>
                        the rest of my lifetime to do it, resting often, sleeping<br>
                        under the pines or, above them, on the unclothed rocks.<br>
                        I want to see how many stars are still in the sky<br>
                        that we have smothered for years now, a century at least.<br>
                        I want to look back at everything, forgiving it all,<br>
                        and peaceful, knowing the last thing there is to know.<br>
                        All that urgency! Not what the earth is about!<br>
                        How silent the trees, their poetry being of themselves only.<br>
                        I want to take slow steps, and think appropriate thoughts.<br>
                        In ten thousand years, maybe, a piece of the mountain will fall.<br>

                  <p>
                    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,<br>
                    The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,<br>
                    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>
                    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;<br>
                    But O heart! heart! heart!<br>
                    O the bleeding drops of red,<br>
                    Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>
                    Fallen cold and dead.
                  </p>
              
                  <p>
                    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br>
                    Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,<br>
                    For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,<br>
                    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br>
                    Here Captain! dear father!<br>
                    This arm beneath your head!<br>
                    It is some dream that on the deck,<br>
                    You’ve fallen cold and dead.
                  </p>
              
                  <p>
                    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,<br>
                    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,<br>
                    The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,<br>
                    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;<br>
                    Exult O shores, and ring O bells!<br>
                    But I with mournful tread,<br>
                    Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>
                    Fallen cold and dead
                  </p>
